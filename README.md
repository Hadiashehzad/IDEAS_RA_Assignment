## Policy Implications

### Citizen typology

1. Fairness-Driven Progressives (around 35–40%)

    Profile: High fairness index, believe inequality is a serious issue.

    View: Support raising top property tax rates

    Trust: Low trust in government institutions


2. Skeptical Pragmatists (around 30–35%)

    Profile: Moderate fairness score

    View: Support moderate reform but fear unintended consequences

    Trust: Mixed; want proof of transparent use of funds

3. Status-Quo Defenders (around 25–30%)

    Profile: Low fairness index, see current tax structure as acceptable.

    View: Oppose raising rates on any group, citing risks to investment and property values.

    Trust: High institutional trust

### Actionable Insights

* Frame the Reform as “Fairness with Accountability.”

    Launch a communication campaign telling that high-value properties will contribute more, ensuring everyone pays their fair share.

    Publish a Property Tax Impact Report each fiscal year showing exactly how revenue improves services (roads, sanitation, public facilities).

* Sequence Implementation Progressively.

    Phase 1: Adjust tax rates for high-value properties first. Align with public fairness expectations and minimize perceived harm.

    Phase 2: Introduce compliance reforms and expand coverage, paired with exemptions or rebates for low-income or small property owners.

    Phase 3: Evaluate outcomes publicly before any broad-base increase.

* Build Procedural Fairness and Institutional Trust.

    Digitize assessments, billing, and grievance systems to reduce discretion and corruption.

    Involve citizens and local councils in monitoring and feedback through open dashboards or public hearings.

    Publish quarterly transparency updates showing tax collection and expenditure by district.

### Sequencing Recommendations for 2025 Reform

* Phase 1 – Communication and Consultation (Q1–Q2):

    Publicize why reform is needed by focusing on fairness, transparency, and efficiency.

    Engage professional bodies like property owners’ associations, urban planners to discuss tax rate design.

* Phase 2 – Pilot and Demonstrate (Q3):

    Introduce progressive top-rate changes first (on high-value properties).

    Complement these with visible service improvements funded by the reform (street upgrades, municipal works).

## Treatment effects on merged data

Across the six treatment arms, behavioral responses (measured by paid_share) were generally high and varied slightly across groups, while beliefs about government spending efficiency showed larger differences. Treatments emphasizing public goods, spending leakage, and elite capture raise expectations about how much of citizens’ taxes would be spent on preferred public services. However, these changes in beliefs did not translate equally into higher payment rates, suggesting a belief and behavior gap. Even when citizens doubted government spending efficiency, compliance remained strong, implying that behavioral responses are influenced by obligation or enforcement rather than confidence in institutions. This highlights the need for communication strategies that strengthen perceived fiscal accountability. Demonstrating transparent and visible use of property tax revenues could convert compliant behavior into lasting trust.


* Phase 3 – Broader Compliance Reform (Q4):

    Strengthen collection mechanisms and close any assessment gaps.

    Communicate fair enforcement and administration of tax rates
